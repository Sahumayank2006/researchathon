  },
  {
    q: 'Do I need a finished paper or even a finished idea before registering?',
    a: 'No. You need a research direction and the willingness to work. The entire point of the sprint is to take you from a rough idea to a structured, submission-ready manuscript with mentor guidance at every stage.',
  },
  {
    q: 'How large can a team be?',
    a: 'Teams may consist of 1 to 4 participants. You may also register individually. Interdisciplinary teams — for example, a CSE student paired with an electronics or biotech student — are encouraged.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Can a faculty member be part of our team?',
    a: 'Yes. One faculty member can be included in a team. The faculty member is counted within the four-member limit, so a team with a faculty member can have at most three students.',
  },
  {
    q: 'What are the prizes?',
    a: 'All prizes are cash prizes: ₹5,100 for the first prize, ₹3,100 for the second and ₹2,100 for the third, plus two consolation prizes of ₹1,100 each. Every participant also receives a certificate.',
  },
  {
    q: 'What exactly is the registration fee?',
    a: 'Amity University Madhya Pradesh students pay ₹200 only, on presentation of a valid student ID. Participants from other institutions pay ₹300. The fee is all-inclusive of the kit, meals, mentorship and certification.',
  },
  {
    q: 'How is formatting and plagiarism actually scored?',
    a: 'Manuscript Quality carries 25% of the total, and both formatting and originality are checked inside it before the jury scores your paper. Your manuscript must follow the IEEE two-column template, and the similarity index must stay below 15%, excluding references. Above 25% similarity leads to disqualification.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Can I use AI tools while drafting?',
    a: 'Yes, but you must disclose it. Any AI-generated text or assistance has to be stated explicitly in the Acknowledgements or Methods section, in line with IEEE AI ethics policies. Undisclosed use is treated as a breach of integrity.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Is publication in IEEE Xplore guaranteed?',
    a: 'No. The event is organised in association with IEEE MP Section, but submission to any journal or conference remains a separate process with its own peer review. What Research-O-Thon guarantees is a complete, publication-ready draft and the discipline to get it there.',
  },
  {
    q: 'What should I bring?',
